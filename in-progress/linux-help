Welcome to the WDS Staging server
=================================

Use the Up/Down arrow keys or Page Up/Page Down arrows keys or the "w" and "z" keys to move up and down.



You may want to learn a bit about Linux before proceeding. It's easy, really, but you would be best off with some intial help.

see http://ducakedhare.co.uk/?page_id=639 for a general primer.

The first topic is about Linux in general, which is a necessary read at some point, but if you want to get experimenting
go to the VirtualBox tutorials.

If you have any questions, you can get in touch with Tai at helpuse.autonomy@gmail.com


In the immediate, here is some help you may find useful

=====================================================================================

    WARNING ::  Undoing changes

There is no "undo" on the Linux command line.
There's rarely any undo on command lines at all.

Linux is a command line UNIX system: it obeys you as efficiently as possible.
However senseless your command.


You need to take your own precautions. Make copies and backups.
Don't overwrite your copies until you're done with them.

    Basic Commands

ls
  list folder ("directory") contents

cd
  "change directory" - go into a different directory

	cd .. - go up one directory
	cd ../.. - go up two directories

pwd
  "print working directory" - tells you where you are

newgrp www-data
  allows you to operate in the web server directory

cd /var/www/html
  go to the web server directory

cat FILENAME
  replace the FILENAME word with the name of an actual file
  dumps the content of the file to screen ("dump to console").
  useful if you want to see a file while also typing

(navigation)
  if your console (commands screen) fills up with lots of text, you can navigate up and down
  by holding Shift key, and using the Pg Up and Pg Down buttons
  on Mac mini-keyboards, hold Shift, and the fn key and use the Up and Down arrows to do the same

mkdir FILENAME
  create a directory with the name FILENAME in the current working directory

less FILENAME
  "less" allows you to read files
  use the Up and Down arrow keys, Page Up or Page Down arrow keys
  you can also use the "w" and "z" keys to move up and down
  type a "/" when in less, then type some text to search for, then hit enter
  when searching, press "n" (small n) to go to the next result
  press "N" (shift and n) to return to the previous character
  press "g" to go to the start of the file
  press "G" to go to the end of the file
  press 'q' to quit

nano FILENAME
  nano allows you to edit a text file
  at the bottom, commands are displayed with ^X and ^O etc
  use the Ctrl key ("^") and "x" (small) to exit
  use Ctrl+o (^O) to write the file to disk

vim FILENAME
  vim is an advanced text editor. You should google "vim tutorial" ;-)
  it's more versatile and powerful than nano, but is quite different from what
  you are likely used to.

emacs FILENAME
  another text editor
  also very powerful
  google for a tutorial
  the choice is up to you which you prefer
  emacs is not installed on this server though....

man COMMAND
  display manual
  replace the COMMAND word with the name of a command to learn more about how to use it
  very useful - try "man ls" or "man nano" for example
  the same navigating and searching mechanisms as for 'less' apply for man

^C
  Ctrl+c when a command is running generally kills it. Dead. Use if something is not quite running right

^Z
  Ctrl+z when a command is running pauses it and returns you to the command line

jobs
  lists any programs still running that you came out of with ^Z
  each program will be preceded by a number

fg [NUM]
  fg on its own returns you to the last job you paused
  fg with a number, for example "fg 2" takes you to the job with that number
  the "[" and "]" characters when describing a command mean the item is optional

bg [NUM]
  when you pause a job with ^Z it is completely paused. If you want it to continue running in the background
  whilst you continue working, set it back in motion with "bg"

cp [FILE] [NEWFILE]
  copies FILE to the location specified by NEWFILE
  note that if NEWFILE already exists, it is completely overwritten!

exit
  come out of the command line

^D
  end of input
  useful if you've typed a command that expects input on the command line but you want to signal that you've finished sending input.
  can only be used on an empty line

^S
  pause the session. Nothing will respond

^Q
  resume a paused session

==================================================================================

     Tab Completion

You can use the TAB key (above caps lock) to use "tab-completion"

Start typing the name of a command and press tab to complete it. If that does not complete the command, press tab again.

Either their are several commands that are spelled the same a tthe beginning and you will be told all of them, or there are no commands of that name.

You can also use tabl completion for file names and file paths. For example type

  cd /va

and then press tab. You end up with "cd /var/". Type some more so that you have

  cd /var/ww/html/wp

and press tab again. It will complete to "cd /var/www/html/wp-". Press tab again to see a list of file starting with "wp-"

==================================================================================

    Globbing

Globbing allows you to refer to groups of files with similar names. Try the following commands:

  ls /var/www/html/
  ls /var/www/html/wp
  ls /var/www/html/wp*
  ls /var/www/html/*.php

The first command lists all teh files in /var/www/html

The second command complains tha there's no "/var/www/html/wp" file

The third command displays all files whose name starts with "/var/www/html/wp", as well as the contents of all directories that start with "wp" too.

The fourth command displays all files inside /var/www/html/ and whose name ends in ".php"

===================================================================================

     Terminals

You can copy and paste in terminals too - they're just a little different from other applications, because the "Ctrl" key is used for other purposes

        Windows

If you are connecting from Windows, you are probably using KiTTY or PuTTY

Select text to copy it

Right-click to paste, or press Shift+Insert keys to paste

        Mac

You are probably using Terminal to connect

Use the Command keys as you normally would to copy and paste

Cmd+C , Cmd+V

        Other

If you are connecting from Linux, from a Chromebook, or another system, you probably use Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V to copy and paste.

You need to instead use Ctrl+Shift+C and Ctrl+Shift+V to paste
