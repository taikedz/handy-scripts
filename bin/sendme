Allows you to send files and compose emails, with prompts.

    ${CGRN}$0 [FILES]${CDEF}

Specify files on the command line to be attached to the mailer program.

You can define the "FROM" and "RCPT" shell variabels in a config file - example

    ${CGRN}cat $HOME/.config/sendme
${CYEL}
        RCPT=me@example.com
        FROM=noreply@bogus.foo
${CDEF}
You can still change these on an ad-hoc basis when running the command.

FUTURE

Future versions will support:
* using the editor defined in EDITOR to edit files
* specifying a template to use
