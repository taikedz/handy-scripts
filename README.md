handy-scripts
=============

<p style="text-alignment: center">Some handy scripts I tend to need all around</p>

A collection of generally useful set of scipts and snippets, and configs.

Rather than a set of gists to copy paste, this is a repository of multiple files that can be deployed collectively.

There's a lot of old stuff from my early linux-learning days, and a lot of horrible bash code. Please don't judge on these contents ;-)
