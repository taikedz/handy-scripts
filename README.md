=============

${a|style="text-alignment: center;"}$ Some handy scripts I tend to need all around

* `af` and `tgpi`
	* package manager wrappers
	* have been moved to [alpacka](https://github.com/taikedz/alpacka)

* `lx`
	* LXC commands wrapper for managing Linux Containers
	* has been moved to [easy-lxc](https://github.com/taikedz/easy-lxc)

* `connect`
	* cli SSH connections manager

* `etherpad`
	* example init script to daemonize etherpad

* `gdiff`
	* lazy git diffing, adding and committing
	* this has been re-developed into a self-containing project using [bash-builder](https://github.com/taikedz/bash-builder)
	* source has moved to `projects/`, its executable is now a binary

* `install`
	* install the useful tools

* `launch`
	* launch a GUI program from the command line, without hogging it

* `gen_ss_ssl`
	* generate an SSL key pair
	* only for private/internal servers
	* for public servers, use Let's Encrypt

* `letsen`
	* let's encrypt automation
	* in development

* `pullall`
	* iterate through child dirs for git folders to git-pull

* `rmkernel.sh`
	* generate script to remove old kernel files in `/boot`

* `rotate-screen`
	* rotate screena and input devices, useful for touch screen usage
	* would suit having a GUI

* `secret`
	* easy gpg key management

* `sendme`
	* mail-utils-based command line emailer, for mailing quick notes to yourself
	* supports some GPG signing features

* `vlcconv`
	* use vlc to convert files. should probably deprecate this in favour of ffmpeg usage
