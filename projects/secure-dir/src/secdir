### secdir Usage:help
# Manage, Mount and Unmount EncFS encrypted directory
# 
# 	secdir {list|init}
# 	secdir {mount|open} ACCOUNT [-to MOUNTPOINT] [LINK ...]
# 	secdir {unmount|close} ACCOUNT
# 
# Uses a .enc directory in the current working directory to store the encrypted files.
# 
# The secure directory is mounted in the current working directory.
# 
# If you do not specify a MOUNTPOINT, creates a directory in the current working directory and mounts there, if allowed.
# 
# 
# OPTIONS
# 
# list
# 	list secure directories by account name configured at current working directory
# 
# init
# 	set current working directory up as a location to store secure directories' encrypted data
# 
# {mount|open} [-to MOUNTPOINT] [LINKS ...]
# 	mount the secure directory. If it does not exist, offers to create it.
#
# 	You can specify `-to MOUNTPOINT` to explicitly mount the directory at that location.
#
# 	You can specify any number of softlinks to create pointing to the mounted directory.
#
# 	Will fail if you cannot write to the mountpoint
#
# 	If you have configured against mounting in the current working directory, you MUST point the `-to MOUNTPOINT`
# 	  to a different location. This allows secure directories to be distributed on a network
# 	  whilst reducing the risk of a user indavertently mounting in a publicly shared directory.
#
# 	  This is a Molly-guard, NOT a security lock.
# 
# {unmount|close}
# 	unmount a mounted secure directory.
#
# 	Any soft links created during mount will be removed.
# 
# CONFIGURATION
# 
# A configuration file is stored in .enc/config. It is an INI-style key-value store
# 
# Mount/load_in_cwd
# 	yes --> allows mounting directories in current working directory
# 	* --> do not allow
# 
# Mount/home
# 	This must be a directory
# 	By default secure directories are mounted here instead of in the current working directory
