Things that need doing

Some of these items shouuld be in help, others can be part of the automation.

Need to be able to preempt when switching to a new branch will cause auto-merge. Problem is, automerge can be crap when dealing with extensive changes so is not necesarily desirable.

One way is to systematically `git stash branch <autogen-name>` to create a new branch and apply the stash there, and provide instructions on how to go to other branch and rebase of this stash

* delete branches
* supprt blames and resets
* support commit ammending
* support unstaging
* display "branch -a" and "branch --merged" when on master (or can we only display branches coming off of current branch?)
* support log reading in less
* add byte formatting to documentation
	* underscore
	* bold
