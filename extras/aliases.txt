Handy aliases to set up


You can set these up in your .bashrc file

Start VIM in insert mode
========================

	alias="vim -c 'startinsert'"

This will start vim in insert mode every time - if you really don't want to get into the habit of pressing "i" or "a" when first opening a file. Or:

	alias="vimi -c 'startinsert'"

To add a special case.
